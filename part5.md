In the [last part](part4), we generated the following figure and began to identify some possible angles for stories:

Now, we'll build a story with (and around) the data.

## 1. Find corroborating evidence to support your claims

If this was a news story, all the steps up to now would really be just the start of the research. I have my story angle and I have some visuals I can include. But this isn't enough.

I may have a what, when, where and who, but I don't have a how and why, which are usually the hardest questions to answer.

I still need to bolster my story with official sources, corroborating evidence, and experts' insights. This means calling up academics in epidemiology, public policy, and behavioural psychology, for example.

And if my findings are challenged by experts, I need to go back and reframe the story, discard assumptions, and try again, with more certainty than before.

## 2. Exercise
What experts and sources would you seek to support your claims in the story? How would you look for them?

Imagine an expert challenges your findings. What would be your next step?

## 3. Humanize the numbers

At this point, you could probably write a fairly cut and dry report with a bunch of stats and quotes from experts. If your audience consists of other experts, that's fine. But if you want to draw in a general audience, you need to tell a story. And stories have characters.

Take a look at some of these data-driven stories that were created recently. They involved months of research, data collection and standardization, and painstaking analysis. But none of them opened with a statistic.



## 2. Identify patterns that inform a story
This chart should start revealing some patterns worthy of further exploration:  
* PEI's line spikes in late August, goes blank, and restarts in mid September. Could this be a data anomaly that you'd need to ask Google about?
* Quebec had the biggest drop in outings to retail and recreation businesses in April, but surged faster than other provinces. What explains this? Perhaps an earlier onset of pandemic fatigue?
* Manitoba saw a sharp drop in December. What happened there?
* The Atlantic provinces all returned to baseline levels up until winter. Does this mean the Atlantic bubble was a success and allowed people there to live normally?

## 3. Exercises 
What other possible story angles do you see? Write a one-paragraph pitch for each one.


Once you've completed the exercises, continue to [part 5](part5) to begin building a story.
