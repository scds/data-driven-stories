# Workshop preparation 
This workshop assumes you have a basic knowledge of spreadsheets and some basic math/stats knowledge. Preparing for this workshop consists of two steps: [Getting the software](#get-the-software) and [Getting the data](#get-the-data). Follow the steps below. 
  
## Get the software
The following software is required or recommended for this tutorial: 
* [**required**] Spreadsheet software. This tutorial will use the web browser-based [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/), though you should be able to achieve similar results with desktop programs like Microsoft Excel or [LibreOffice Calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/).
* [**required**] [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/)--a free version of the Tableau data visualization and analysis software. 
* [**optional**] A text editor to convert the character encoding in the data file. [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) is recommended for Windows, while [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/2) or [TextMate](https://macromates.com/) is recommended for Macs.

Please contact the [Sherman Centre](mailto:scds@mcmaster.ca) if you have any difficulties downloading or opening the software.
  
## Get the data
For this workshop, we'll be working with Google mobility data made available through the Google [COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports website](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/). 

Before downloading data, take some time to explore the website. Read the [documentation](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/data_documentation.html?hl=en). Understand a bit what's in the data, what to expect, how it was collected. 

You can download the dataset for this workshop by clicking on the ![download button](assets/img/region-csv.PNG?s=100) link. It will download a zip file with detailed data for every country tracked by Google. For this workshop, we're interested only in the Canadian dataset (```2020_CA_Region_Mobility_Report.csv```). Once the file is downloaded, unzip the whole folder, or drag out the Canadian file into another folder to extract the single file. 





Proceed to [Part 1]() of the workshop to being exploring the data.
