## Open your data in a spreadsheet
If you haven't already downloaded and opened a properly-encoded version of the dataset, following the instructions on the [preparation page](preparation#get-the-data) before proceeding. 

## Get to know the data
Take some time to understand the data structure. What do the columns mean? What data types are there (categories, dates, numbers, etc.). 
* Is the data in [wide or long](https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/wide-and-long-data/) format?
* Explore some of the variables in each column. Activate the [column filters](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3540681?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) and inspect the unique values. Try sorting some of the numerical columns from highest to lowest (and vice-versa).
* Undo your changes each time if you want to go back to the data's original order.

## Exercises

Now that you have some familiarity with the raw data, answer a few questions:
1. Before doing any analysis, what do you think the data could tell you? What can't it tell you?
2. Imagine the dataset is a human source. What questions would you ask of it during an interview?


Once you've completed the exercises, continue to [part 2](part2) to reshape and visualize the data.
