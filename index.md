# Telling a data-driven story from start to finish.
*A Relevant Research Series workshop.*

In this workshop, you'll be taken through all the steps of the creation of a data-driven story, from obtaining the data, to listing possible story ideas.

We'll be using [Google Community Mobility data](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) for Canadian provinces to see which places have changed their movements the most (or least) throughout the Covid-19 pandemic so far.

This is a process that has worked for me during seven years as a data journalist. However, it's not necessarily the best method and certainly not the only method. I developed it over years of trial and error, borrowing parts from other news organizations and from data science courses I've taken.

The steps are:

* Obtain the data and software 
* Do some basic exploratory analysis in Google Sheets and inspect it for anomalies and errors that need to be addressed
* Think about how the data was collected and what biases could be embedded in it
* Do a more in-depth exploratory visualization using Tableau Public
* Identify possible story angles and finding characters to humanize the numbers
